# ceserver-pcileech

Ceserver-pcileech allows using Cheat Engine against a remote machine, without the need to install ANY software on that
remote machine. It was developed independently from the Cheat Engine software by DarkByte and PCILeech by Ulf Frisk, and
is not affiliated with either.

All Cheat Engine functions may not be available. Currently implemented is the ability to:

* Connect to a Process
* Read Memory
* Write Memory
* Search Memory
* Browse Memory
* View Module Listing
* Generate Pointer Map
* Pointer Scan

Other functions may or may not work (likely the latter).

# Terminology

* "Source": The machine running Cheat Engine and PCILeech.
* "Target": The machine running the process to be inspected/altered.

# Prerequisites

* Two machines running Windows
* [MemProcFS](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS) running on the source machine (part of the PCILeech ecosystem by Ulf Frisk)
* Additional requirements, including possibly the purchase of a hardware FPGA card if you choose to go that route. See
  the [PCILeech documentation](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech/blob/master/readme.md) for your particular use case.
